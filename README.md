# BGE-Master-Template

So yeah, i just made an account here and have no idea what i am doing. But here it is, my Master Template for the Blender Game Engine. I know, i know, the BGE is a shitty engine, but now since it's on GitHub, i am sure it will look super dank legit professional and be 1002% better because of that instantly.

Who knows, maybe it will actually be useful.

At least i tried.
